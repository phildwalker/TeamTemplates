# TeamTemplates

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of TeamTemplates is to help provide some framework to quickly
get to a to a useful analysis.

Currently providing templates for a single page analysis and another for
a simple rmarkdown website.

# Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("phildwalker/Templates")
```

# Notes

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

# Thanks!

Huge thank you to Michael DeWitt and Jennifer Wenner from whom I learned
a ton from at Cone.
